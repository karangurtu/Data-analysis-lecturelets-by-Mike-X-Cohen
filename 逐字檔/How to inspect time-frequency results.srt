1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
if you are not very familiar or

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:08,250
comfortable with with looking at results

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,949
of time frequency based analyses it

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,259
might initially seem a bit intimidating

5
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:15,959
or confusing how to interpret all these

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,179
different features all these different

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,140
colors and dimensions and so here I'm

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:24,929
going to introduce you to kind of how to

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,630
think about how to look at results of

10
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:30,198
time frequency based analyses lest you

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,780
think that this is a kind of a

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,789
patronizing lecture then let me assure

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,910
you that these five steps that I will

14
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:41,339
introduce you to are exactly these steps

15
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,949
in the same order that I use every time

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,710
I'm looking at time frequency results

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,170
whether they are from my own data

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,429
analyses or if I'm reading a paper or

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,640
reviewing a manuscript so here's the

20
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:59,460
five-step plan step one is to determine

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,680
actually what is even being shown on the

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,960
plot generally the most typically shown

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,880
feature of the data to show in time

24
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,079
frequency plots is power this is the the

25
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,079
intensity or the strength of the

26
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:20,840
frequency band specific activity over

27
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:23,280
time but people will also show

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,680
connectivity results or correlation with

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,239
behavior or all sorts of things so it's

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,360
important to make sure you know actually

31
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:34,349
what feature of the data is being shown

32
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:37,890
in the plots that's the first step step

33
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:40,890
two is to inspect the ranges and the

34
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,728
limits of the plot so what is on the x

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,879
and y axes most of the time the x-axis

36
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,739
shows time and most of the time the y

37
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,158
axis shows frequency but that's not

38
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:57,209
necessarily the case for example

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,149
sometimes particularly in studies of of

40
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,578
yes sort of intracranial recordings

41
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,340
where they have laminar electrodes that

42
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,529
goes through the cortex the y-axis might

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,259
actually show depth of the cortex and

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,789
not frequency so it's important to

45
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,879
inspect the axes and make sure you know

46
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,840
what is being

47
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:21,430
plottin what is the color limit or the

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,409
grayscale intensity so this is related

49
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,439
to what is being shown it could be that

50
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:28,319
the color refers to power but it's

51
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,810
important to determine whether it's

52
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:36,069
absolute power or power relative to a

53
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,680
baseline and so on and then you want to

54
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:42,579
have a quick look around inside the plot

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,760
and see if any activity seems to be cut

56
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,130
off on the edges or maybe saturated by

57
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,769
the color limit so you can't really get

58
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:56,049
a full picture of what's going on in the

59
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:59,200
in the plot okay step three is to look

60
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,719
at the results and one of the things you

61
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,169
want to look for is to see if the

62
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,770
results are distributed in time

63
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:10,539
frequency space or if they are more

64
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,790
localized so this will help you in

65
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:15,400
interpreting the results and I'll give

66
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:20,289
you some examples of what I mean by this

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,650
on the next slide you should understand

68
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:25,959
what is what what are the the this what

69
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,030
is the subspace of the total time

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,920
frequency analysis that is being shown

71
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,080
in the plot if it's a time frequency

72
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,809
power plotted it's likely that they're

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,790
showing only the results from one

74
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,490
electrode or maybe they're showing only

75
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:42,759
from one frequency or only from one time

76
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:45,790
window and this is not necessarily that

77
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,489
the authors are trying to fool you or

78
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:50,079
trying to manipulate you into only

79
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,980
looking at a tiny piece of their data

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,460
it's unfortunately simply the case that

81
00:03:52,979 --> 00:04:01,149
time frequency based analyses deliver a

82
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,280
very large and high dimensional space

83
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,680
and as we'll learn in the future it's

84
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,599
it's actually quite common to have

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,379
something like a five dimensional hyper

86
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,139
cube of results and we humans are

87
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:16,029
generally not very good at viewing or

88
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,159
interpreting these kinds of large

89
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:21,159
dimensional spaces and so we have to

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,939
take slices of these spaces so it's fine

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,260
but there should be some kind of

92
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,629
justifiable motivation

93
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,899
either based on theory or based on

94
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,360
previous literature or based on some

95
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:36,370
characteristics of the data that

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,980
motivates you that motivate the authors

97
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,290
only to show the results from one

98
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,069
electrode for example so it's part of

99
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:48,160
looking at the results in step 4

100
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,959
is we try to link the results to the

101
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,230
experiment design assuming that there is

102
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:55,000
some kind of task you want to know what

103
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,790
is happening at time zero is it a

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,879
stimulus that came on the screen or an

105
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:03,220
auditory stimulus or a button press or

106
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,480
some kind of response are there multiple

107
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,950
tasks events and how are these

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,009
represented or shown in the time

109
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:15,639
frequency plot and finally Step five is

110
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:19,269
to try and understand these statistical

111
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,669
procedures that are that are shown in

112
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:23,439
the plot so for example is there any

113
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,840
statistical special holding at all maybe

114
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,480
there are there is no statistical

115
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,459
threshold in which case the analyses

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,660
should be considered qualitative rather

117
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:37,089
than quantitative um if statistics were

118
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,820
performed at every time frequency pixel

119
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,519
our multiple comparisons issues

120
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:47,019
addressed are the analyses more geared

121
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:50,079
towards data exploration or are they

122
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:52,719
more hypothesis driven we will discuss

123
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,149
these differentiations in the future

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,120
when we talk about statistics but these

125
00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:01,959
will will will change the how you

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,180
interpret the results okay so here's the

127
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:08,919
five-step plan now let's see how this

128
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,920
works in action so here we have a time

129
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,430
frequency plot and now we are going to

130
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,930
go through these five steps and and and

131
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,490
just sort of inspect this plot so step

132
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,110
one determine what is being shown on the

133
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,790
plot here we see it's very clearly

134
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,879
written in the title this is decibel

135
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,069
converted time frequency power and we

136
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,779
don't know what electrode is being shown

137
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,149
here but I happen to know that it's

138
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:36,369
electrode FC Zed which is a frontal

139
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:38,739
central electrode and we can see these

140
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,379
are so we don't know exactly what the

141
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,269
baseline

142
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:43,490
period is but presumably it's somewhere

143
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:45,649
around here here you can see the color

144
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,340
values so they its symmetric it goes

145
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:54,979
from minus 3 to plus 3 decibels relative

146
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:57,560
to baseline okay inspect the ranges and

147
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,360
limits of the plot so we see some of the

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,920
baseline activity which is nice here's

149
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,920
time zero goes up to a thousand

150
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,860
milliseconds and we get frequencies from

151
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,680
maybe like two or three Hertz up to

152
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,560
around forty Hertz and we can see that a

153
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,730
lot of the main time frequency dynamics

154
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,050
are contained within this time frequency

155
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:23,840
window there do appear to be some

156
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:27,650
features that are sort of leaking out

157
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,810
you know outside into the into higher

158
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:32,479
frequencies so it's possible that there

159
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,550
is some higher frequency dynamics that

160
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,550
we are just missing in this plot because

161
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,290
it only goes to 40 Hertz but so that

162
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,740
that's not really clear there might be

163
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:45,550
something here as well but this is

164
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,439
possibly if this is a a sort of fast

165
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:53,990
experiment design this might actually be

166
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:56,360
the beginning of the next trial so step

167
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,579
3 look at the results here we see quite

168
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,720
a few interesting features so there's

169
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:05,389
this kind of long ish theta response

170
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,120
increased relative to baseline and it

171
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,519
appears to be flanked by these two sort

172
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,759
of bursts of upper alpha somewhere

173
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:15,680
around 10 to 15 Hertz and then of course

174
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,370
there's this very prominent beta band

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,670
suppression from 20 to around 20 30

176
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,829
Hertz or so and this seems also to come

177
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,600
in beats and actually it looks like it's

178
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:33,949
maybe even a little something happening

179
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:35,509
before a stimulus onset okay so now we

180
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,120
linked the results to the experimental

181
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:41,990
design I happen to know that this plot

182
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,700
came from an experiment that was that

183
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,980
involved um cognitive control and

184
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,990
response conflict and in this literature

185
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,730
it is very typical to see theta

186
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,370
increases after stimulus

187
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,379
and corresponding roughly to the time of

188
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,120
the response which could be somewhere

189
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:02,689
around five or six hundred milliseconds

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,639
so this seems to fit very well into what

191
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,680
I know about this experiment when I know

192
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:12,909
about this literature these other

193
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:15,709
features are you know maybe the yeah

194
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:17,120
these may or may not be sort of relevant

195
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,269
but you know we want to kind of keep

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,720
these in mind the the reaction time the

197
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:24,949
average response time is somewhere

198
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
generally around five or six hundred

199
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,450
milliseconds and so some of these

200
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,759
dynamics might be related to the

201
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,890
response rather than to the stimulus per

202
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,950
se though it's a little bit difficult to

203
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:41,269
tell exactly from this plot just based

204
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:45,920
on on our on this plot because we don't

205
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:47,870
see their responses locked plot and

206
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,179
finally statistical procedures actually

207
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,299
there are none I see no contours there's

208
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:55,759
no kind of boxes drawn around so we

209
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:57,589
don't know exactly what is and is not

210
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,710
statistically significant in this plot

211
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,980
and so we just interpret this as a kind

212
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:07,370
of qualitative glimpse of the landscape

213
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,789
of activity here rather than knowing

214
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,549
exactly what can be statistically

215
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:15,110
evaluated okay so that was the five-step

216
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:17,929
plan and this is really what happens

217
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,000
inside my head when I first look at time

218
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:23,049
frequency results of course I do it a

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,419
little bit faster in my head compared to

220
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:28,549
now when I'm introducing it but if you

221
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:32,419
are new to time frequency based analyses

222
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:34,429
I recommend going through these stages

223
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:39,979
in order to understand what's being

224
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:43,939
shown to you so one of the things that

225
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:47,779
people often use time frequency based

226
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,610
analyses to to make inferences about is

227
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:54,799
is neural oscillations brain

228
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:57,379
oscillations and so there is a debate

229
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,779
that keeps coming up in literature about

230
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,570
whether these findings actually reflect

231
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:06,049
neural oscillations and the issue here

232
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,540
is that or the question is whether

233
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:12,250
a feature that you see in time-frequency

234
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:14,269
space necessarily corresponds to a an

235
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,208
oscillation in the way that we

236
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:21,980
understand neuro physiological

237
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:27,578
oscillations to to occur in large part

238
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:30,709
this this argument arises because of the

239
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:33,649
feature of the Fourier theorem so this I

240
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:36,289
presume is a picture of Joseph Fourier

241
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,389
at least according to Wikipedia this is

242
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:41,240
what he looked like

243
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:44,389
we will discuss later that the Fourier

244
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,959
transform is actually quite a remarkable

245
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:50,750
and powerful data analysis technique but

246
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,458
what the Fourier transform or what what

247
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:56,629
the Fourier transform does is allow us

248
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:59,838
to represent any signal using a

249
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:04,669
combination of sine waves and awesome

250
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,490
basically oscillatory processes one of

251
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:09,708
these sort of curious features of the

252
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,169
Fourier transform is that it does not

253
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:14,689
require that the signal is oscillatory

254
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:17,588
or even periodic the Fourier transform

255
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,839
as we will learn in the future is a

256
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:23,300
perfect representation of any signal so

257
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:29,180
this is Fourier giving is evil laugh

258
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:32,809
here because this the the data do not

259
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:37,219
necessarily need to exhibit oscillations

260
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:39,109
in order for in order for us to get

261
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,930
results that can be represented in a

262
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,089
time frequency power play so in this

263
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,919
debate if someone asks you about this is

264
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,260
this really a neural oscillation can you

265
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,028
interpret this signal this feature in

266
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,458
your time frequency space as in neural

267
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:55,789
oscillation I think it is very important

268
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:58,698
to make a clear distinction between two

269
00:12:55,789 --> 00:13:00,409
orthogonal questions that are two

270
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:04,669
orthogonal issues that are often

271
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:07,610
confused in this discussion one question

272
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:12,019
is our time frequency based analyses

273
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:15,829
useful in analyzing EEG LFP and MHz data

274
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:18,589
and a second question which i think is

275
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,669
it's really orthogonal is totally

276
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,600
uncorrelated with

277
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:26,959
first question is is an interpretation

278
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,690
of an a neural oscillation appropriate

279
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:35,230
in this particular case so let me just

280
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,230
address these two questions very briefly

281
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,799
there are a few disadvantages of time

282
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:46,849
domain analyses including that any

283
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,269
activity that is jittered or non

284
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,879
phase-locked these dynamics are lost

285
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:54,949
they are invisible they're very limited

286
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,549
analysis possibilities such as

287
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,759
connectivity cross frequency coupling

288
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:04,849
event-related potentials or time domain

289
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,490
trial averaging often has low signal to

290
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,779
noise and low statistical power

291
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,879
particularly for the later more

292
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:14,179
cognitive or associative components so

293
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:17,139
things happening after around 150 or 200

294
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:20,289
milliseconds this is actually not a

295
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:24,889
mathematical requirement or necessity

296
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:26,379
but empirically this tends to be

297
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:30,460
observed

298
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:33,110
furthermore the these sort of

299
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,450
biophysical or physiological mechanisms

300
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,269
that produce a mere piece particularly

301
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:41,320
the later ear piece are are relatively

302
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:44,120
unclear now we can contrast these

303
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,940
disadvantages with advantages of time

304
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,669
frequency based analyses it allows you

305
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,620
to interpret your results in more nerve

306
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:53,389
physiologically meaningful ways as I'll

307
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,370
get to in a minute

308
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:58,490
and it's it provides a very flexible

309
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,769
framework for many types of analyses not

310
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,860
only time frequency power but phase

311
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:06,409
dynamics connectivity dynamics frequency

312
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,960
coupling dynamics there are many

313
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:12,620
so-called low-hanging fruits this means

314
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,740
that there are many aspects of brain

315
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,129
function and cognitive function that are

316
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,529
yet to be sort of fully charted with

317
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:24,049
time frequency based analyses so this is

318
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,709
useful if you are trying to make a niche

319
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:30,529
in some literature and make some new

320
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:33,220
discoveries um time frequency based

321
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:36,039
analyses are also very amenable

322
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,660
to strict hypothesis testing and also to

323
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:42,610
kind of open exploratory data analyses

324
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:44,139
so this is an advantage and of course

325
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,519
they also produce very nice colored

326
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:51,339
plots that is not really a scientific

327
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,490
advantage but that's okay so these are

328
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,790
all arguments for using time frequency

329
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,610
based analyses in addition to or instead

330
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:04,000
of time domain only analyses like

331
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:07,060
event-related potentials and this all of

332
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,629
these except I guess for this one but

333
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:12,039
these have nothing whatsoever to do with

334
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:15,370
interpreting your results in a framework

335
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:19,948
of neuro physiological oscillations

336
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:22,600
these are entirely about having a a rich

337
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:25,479
information packed signal and we want to

338
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,899
extract or we are using time frequency

339
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,120
based analyses to extract more

340
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,339
information than what we can get from

341
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,429
event related potential analysis or time

342
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:39,009
domain analyses so this is an answer to

343
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:43,299
orthogonal question number one so now

344
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:47,699
let's get two orthogonal question two is

345
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:50,919
it safe or how confident can we be about

346
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:53,669
interpreting a feature in a time

347
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:58,289
frequency plot as a neural oscillation

348
00:16:53,669 --> 00:17:00,639
here the issue is that the term

349
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:02,259
oscillation in the context of

350
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,558
neuroscience in in the field of

351
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:08,620
neuroscience is kind of a loaded term in

352
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:14,828
the sense that there there are a number

353
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:17,828
of studied and understood biophysical

354
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:20,438
mechanisms that produce periodic

355
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:22,959
dynamics in neurons and in populations

356
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,159
of neurons and so when we are measuring

357
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,350
at the macroscopic scale even even with

358
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:31,900
an LFP so even with a micro wire that

359
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:34,769
you just is inserted into the brain but

360
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:38,740
it then is low-pass filtered to extract

361
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:41,319
sort of lower frequency components this

362
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:45,279
is a a pretty macroscopic signal

363
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:47,929
relative to the biophysical dynamics

364
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:52,680
that produce oscillations

365
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:55,320
so that that is is the the issue of

366
00:17:52,680 --> 00:18:00,720
interpreting features of time-frequency

367
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:02,730
analyses as neural oscillations in my

368
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,950
opinion this boils down to the

369
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,680
distinction between a manifest variable

370
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,200
and a latent contract so there are

371
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,789
things that we presume are happening in

372
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,039
the brain and these are neural

373
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:16,049
oscillations and then there is the thing

374
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,920
that we actually measure so we cannot

375
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:22,470
directly measure all components of all

376
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,539
neurons so it's difficult to really

377
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,329
determine with a hundred percent

378
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:31,409
certainty that this thing that we see is

379
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:33,089
an oscillation but so we do the best

380
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:37,410
with the thing that we can see which is

381
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:40,439
the manifest variable so interpreting a

382
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,420
feature of a manifest variable in the

383
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,180
framework of the latent construct that

384
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,750
you have some theoretical motivation to

385
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:54,180
to to make this link this is actually

386
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:55,980
very similar to many other relationships

387
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,529
between manifest variables and latent

388
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:02,009
constructs that we see in psychology in

389
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:04,259
sociology and definitely in in cognitive

390
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:06,480
neuroscience and in neuroscience more

391
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,690
generally so one might also ask the

392
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,529
question is the fMRI bold response

393
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:17,160
neural activity or is a condition

394
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:18,899
difference in reaction time something

395
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,509
called attention as cognitive state

396
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,990
called attention in both they are in all

397
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:27,000
three of these cases we have a a latent

398
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,730
construct so we have something called

399
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,880
neural activity we have something called

400
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,279
attention a cognitive operation called

401
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,140
attention and then we have the manifest

402
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,649
variable which is the bold response or

403
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,050
reaction time or an EEG time frequency

404
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:46,170
feature and so I think this is the best

405
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:49,470
way to think about this question can we

406
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:52,650
interpret an a feature of time frequency

407
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:55,799
results as being as reflecting a neural

408
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:58,440
oscillation yes to the extent that we

409
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,799
treat these as manifest variables these

410
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,230
are measurable things

411
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,339
in the world and we use these in order

412
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:11,920
to make inferences about something that

413
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,919
is more difficult to measure directly
