1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,250
when you think about the human brain

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,129
probably an image comes into your mind

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,750
that looks something like this it's a

4
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:12,539
continuous sheet of folded cortex

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,519
comprising many many no one really knows

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,788
how many neurons and of course many

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,429
other types of cells however for the

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,830
remainder of your career as an EEG or m

9
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,219
EG researcher you should think about the

10
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:29,448
brain not as a continuous sheet

11
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:32,640
comprising neurons but instead as a

12
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:37,649
surface that contains many independent

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,210
nodes or vertices each one functionally

14
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,370
a modulus so let's see what this looks

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,160
like we can zoom in a little bit here

16
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:47,849
into the brain and now we want to be

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:50,759
thinking about the brain as comprising

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,730
functionally homogeneous you might call

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,549
these columns or hyper columns or we can

20
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,049
just refer to them as tubes so these are

21
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,399
like tubes in the brain each one is

22
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:05,338
approximately 1 to 2 millimeters in

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,560
diameter each one contains somewhere

24
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:11,670
around ten thousand to a hundred

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,859
thousand neurons and all of the neural

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,859
dynamics and neuro physiological and

27
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,530
biophysical dynamics that are happening

28
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:21,780
inside each of these tubes is the same

29
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,180
it is functionally homogeneous what's

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,989
happening inside this tube of course

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,659
this is not entirely realistic in the

32
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:32,489
real brain there is also there are all

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,409
sorts of dynamics that are happening at

34
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:37,259
a spatial scale smaller than this

35
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,530
however this is approximately the

36
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,670
smallest spatial scale that can be

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,670
measured with EEG or M eg so this is how

38
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,409
you should try to conceptualize the the

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,530
brain when you are interpreting your

40
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,600
your eg Remy G data of course if you're

41
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,460
measuring L FPS where you have

42
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,319
electrodes that are implanted inside the

43
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,509
brain the spatial scale can be

44
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,148
considerably smaller than this but this

45
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:08,180
is about the smallest spatial scale that

46
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,180
you can resolve with EEG or any gene

47
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,359
okay and each one of these tubes is

48
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,789
producing electrical field or my bed

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,360
fields that you measure from outside

50
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:21,129
then now typically in your experiments

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,670
you record not only from one electrode

52
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:27,280
but from many electrodes this is a

53
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:32,169
visual representation of the locations

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:37,300
of electrodes from a 64 electrode cap

55
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:39,609
and hopefully going into the future 64

56
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,300
electrodes will be seen as kind of the

57
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,910
minimum number of electrodes and

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,820
something like 128 or more than 200

59
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:51,099
electrodes will become increasingly

60
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,590
widely used and and become standard

61
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,379
nonetheless so here you see 64

62
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,120
electrodes laid out on a 2 dimensional

63
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,219
representation of the head this is

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,879
called a topographical plot or a

65
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:06,129
topographical map and in case you are

66
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,560
not familiar with interpreting these

67
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,239
plots what you want to do is imagine you

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,060
were looking down on the top of

69
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,969
someone's head and here is the left ear

70
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,920
and the right ear and this is the nose

71
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,159
and now these are the locations of the

72
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,289
electrodes and now what we want to do is

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,340
try to understand how or to visualize

74
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:31,409
how the activity is changing over the

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,409
entire scalp over the entire surface

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,299
so of course you the data that you

77
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:40,169
record from any one electrode might look

78
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:43,209
something like this and most of the

79
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,750
tutorials and lectures from from this

80
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,489
point on will really deal with how to

81
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,219
analyze and out to extract information

82
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,799
out of the time series that you get from

83
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,889
a single electrode but in practice yeah

84
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,680
you really want to look at the change of

85
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:02,979
activity over space as a function of

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,390
space so there are a few different ways

87
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,798
of representing these spatial

88
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:09,939
information that you get from EEG data

89
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,090
here you see probably the most

90
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:16,120
conservative visual representation so

91
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,970
the activity of each electrode is mapped

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,990
onto a color or in this case a gray

93
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:25,630
intensity value so here you see let's

94
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,689
imagine that black is mapped onto lower

95
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,550
levels of active

96
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,730
in whites is mapped on to higher levels

97
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,740
of activity this is a very conservative

98
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,890
way of illustrating the spatial

99
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,079
distribution of the data because we are

100
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,879
not making any assumptions about what

101
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,949
the activity might look like between

102
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,069
these electrodes but on the other hand

103
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:49,479
it's also a little bit difficult to

104
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:53,810
interpret this plot so by far the most

105
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,610
typical way to analyze or to to

106
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,629
illustrate the spatial distribution of

107
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,910
EEG data is with these interpolated

108
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:03,319
two-dimensional topographical maps and

109
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,090
in a few minutes we'll switch to my lap

110
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,360
and I will show you how to make these

111
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:11,119
topographical maps but the idea is that

112
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,389
we don't actually record any data from

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,670
this point here we record this is a

114
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,039
point that's in between these electrodes

115
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,980
where we actually record data but we

116
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,500
want to use an interpolation algorithm

117
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,390
to estimate what the activity would look

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,790
like at this point in this point in this

119
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:33,019
point in this point and so forth in

120
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:37,660
order to produce a smoother plot which

121
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:40,279
is easier to interpret here you see a

122
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,140
this same activity so actually all three

123
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,000
of these plots show exactly the same

124
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,269
data just represented in different ways

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,470
here you see the representation on a 3d

126
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:53,168
rendering of a head so there's some

127
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,190
advantages and disadvantages of

128
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:57,349
three-dimensional topographical plotting

129
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,569
versus two-dimensional topographical

130
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,300
blooding of course the three-dimensional

131
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:05,019
plots look much nicer they make nicer

132
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:09,250
figures and they're certainly more than

133
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:12,229
directly interpretable in terms of the

134
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,199
anatomical distribution of the activity

135
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:18,290
so it's much easier to see where on the

136
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,629
head these different features are coming

137
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,300
from on the other hand of course you

138
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,009
only see half the header or even a bit

139
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,340
less than half that idea so if you

140
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:30,680
wanted to show what the entire spatial

141
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:35,119
distribution of activity looked like you

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,189
would need at least two different 3d

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,579
plots and maybe even three if you had

144
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,920
some

145
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:41,839
if you wanted to show the activity here

146
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,759
all the way poster and here all the way

147
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,689
anterior but you would certainly need

148
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,879
more than one to show the entire head

149
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,649
two-dimensional plots in the other end

150
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,920
have the advantage of showing pretty

151
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:56,409
much the entire spatial distribution

152
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,110
from the entire head on one plot

153
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,950
sometimes they get cut off this a

154
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:06,110
parameter for how much of these data

155
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,240
coming from behind the head you you want

156
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,490
to show here but they show pretty much

157
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,470
the entire topographical distribution

158
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,379
but there are a little bit more

159
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:19,730
difficult to interpret in terms of the

160
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:25,339
anatomical scalp localization of the

161
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:29,150
effects topographical maps are very

162
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:32,659
important they are very powerful and and

163
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:35,329
should be used very often in particular

164
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,390
not only when you are inspecting your

165
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,469
results and showing images of your

166
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:42,560
results after you've completed your

167
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,510
analyses but also during pre-processing

168
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,470
and during the cleaning and initial

169
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,360
inspection of the data topographical

170
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,460
maps are are very powerful and you can

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,430
extract a lot of meaningful information

172
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:57,079
very quickly and so here we see two

173
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,810
topographical maps this one all I'm

174
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,629
telling you is that it's a topographical

175
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,160
map of the activity at 130 milliseconds

176
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:06,199
I'm not telling you anything else about

177
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,290
this I'm not telling you what happened

178
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,449
at time zero but you can already come up

179
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,240
with a pretty good guess just based on

180
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,339
looking at this plot that at time zero

181
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,370
there was a visual stimulus that was

182
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:21,379
presented and you might also guess that

183
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,730
the stimulus was presented on the right

184
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,399
side of the screen so in the right

185
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,290
visual hemifield and in fact that is

186
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,859
what happened in this experiment there

187
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,899
was at time zero a stimulus presented on

188
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,259
the right side of the screen this is

189
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,840
very useful for example if this was the

190
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:41,000
first subject in your pilot experiment

191
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,980
that you were testing and let's say this

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,419
is supposed to be the condition where

193
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,060
there was a stimulus presented on the

194
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:51,059
left side of the screen so now you know

195
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:53,069
this should raise some alarm bells that

196
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:56,189
perhaps something went wrong with the

197
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:00,870
experiment trigger coding the the

198
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:03,000
labeling of the markers or something so

199
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,330
it provides a bit of a sanity check

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,299
looking at these topographical maps here

201
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,190
you see at 400 milliseconds now again

202
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,990
I'm not telling you what happens at 400

203
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,090
milliseconds but you can probably guess

204
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,649
by looking at the plot that it's likely

205
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,290
that there was a button press maybe

206
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:21,480
there was even a right hand button press

207
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,980
maybe the subject press bun with the

208
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,659
right hand at somewhere around 400

209
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,420
milliseconds and that's reflected as

210
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:29,009
motor activity in fact this is what

211
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,439
happened in this experiment that

212
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:34,679
somewhere around 400 milliseconds there

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,430
was a response using the right hand so

214
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,289
already

215
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:40,139
these topographical maps are telling you

216
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:42,509
a lot of very important and detailed

217
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,909
information that you can use during

218
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:48,419
pre-processing to check and make sure

219
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:50,639
that the data are are good and clean and

220
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,979
consistent with what you should expect

221
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,980
based on the design of your experiment

222
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,110
topographical maps are also very useful

223
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:04,070
for identifying potentially bad or

224
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,600
artifact ridden electrodes here you see

225
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,900
several a series of topographical maps

226
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,029
the numbers here correspond to time in

227
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,850
milliseconds so this is a quarter second

228
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,379
after stimulus onset and it's very clear

229
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,120
it's very obvious that something is

230
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,340
wrong with this electrode you can see it

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,289
has very large values and they're very

232
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,540
different from the neighboring electrode

233
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:26,819
so we know immediately by looking at

234
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:29,309
these topographical maps that something

235
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,310
was wrong with this electrode so we need

236
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,409
to resolve this issue before going any

237
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:41,939
further with these with the data

238
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:46,319
analyses I would like to clarify two

239
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:49,560
terms that are kind of related and and a

240
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,390
little bit easy to confuse but they are

241
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,609
actually there there is an important

242
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:55,949
difference between them and the terms

243
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,870
are topographical localization versus

244
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,590
brain localization and also sometimes

245
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,820
called source localization the

246
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,030
difference between these two terms is

247
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,879
illustrated by these two

248
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,730
pictures here I apologize for the really

249
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,620
ugly pixelated nature of this

250
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,110
topographical map but it was it was very

251
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:18,009
small on the figure and I had to blow it

252
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:20,919
up anyway topographical localization is

253
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:24,159
really just an observation of where your

254
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:27,009
effect is maximal on the scalp so here

255
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,049
we see the effect whatever this is the

256
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:33,100
statistical map this condition contrast

257
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:36,189
is larger at this electrode than it is

258
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,100
at any other electrode on the scalp so

259
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,520
we can localize the effect to this

260
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,129
particular electrode as opposed to any

261
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,009
other electrode with topographical

262
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:50,100
localization we are not making any

263
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:54,189
assumptions we don't need any special

264
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,440
analyses we don't need any specific sets

265
00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:00,040
of parameters we are really just

266
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,580
observing and commenting on where an

267
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:07,480
effect is empirically observed to be

268
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:12,340
localized to on the on the scalp that's

269
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:15,550
a different query know where in the

270
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,680
brain this dynamic came from where where

271
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:20,109
in the brain the source is all we know

272
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,659
is that it is maximal at this particular

273
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:26,409
electrode brain localization of course

274
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:28,569
we want to make an inference about where

275
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:31,419
in the brain this activity may have come

276
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,640
from in brain localization or source

277
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:36,399
localization does require specific

278
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,460
algorithms like dipole fitting or

279
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,100
beamforming or any other source

280
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,650
localization algorithm source

281
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,680
localization requires some assumptions

282
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,019
it requires several parameters so and

283
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,819
the inference is is different here we

284
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,179
are trying to make an inference about

285
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,370
where in the brain did the activity come

286
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:59,529
from that produced the observed scalp

287
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,200
topography and here with topographical

288
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,959
localization we are really just asking

289
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,390
the very simple and and and definitely

290
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:12,370
answerable question of which electrode

291
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:15,789
shows the effect the biggest okay so now

292
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:19,509
I'd like to switch to map

293
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:23,889
here if you download these sample Ichi

294
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:27,519
data and the code that that is presented

295
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:29,649
along with this video you can don't

296
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,840
follow along with this code so what

297
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,600
we're going to do here is or what I'm

298
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,009
going to do is introduce you to

299
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,759
topographical plotting basically I'm

300
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:42,269
going to let's see show you how these

301
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:48,370
kinds of topographical plots are

302
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:51,329
produced in MATLAB the first step that

303
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,649
we're going to do is transform the

304
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:57,129
Cartesian coordinates to polar

305
00:13:53,649 --> 00:14:00,909
coordinates which is important for the

306
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:06,009
next steps once we have that we can plot

307
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:07,839
the XY locations of the electrodes and

308
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,789
here I'm using a function called scatter

309
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,090
which is very similar to the plot

310
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:14,949
function in fact you could produce

311
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,019
exactly the same plot with the plot

312
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,830
function is just sort of shown here just

313
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:23,169
for your personal edification so this

314
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,210
should look familiar this is just the

315
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:27,250
layout of all the electrodes this is

316
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,700
very similar to what I showed in the

317
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:34,240
slides except that in the slides that

318
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,879
was produced from an EEG lab toolbox

319
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,250
function that basically just plots these

320
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,439
electrodes plus adds some circles for

321
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,240
the head and the ears and the nose and

322
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,330
so on but this is just the electrode

323
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:52,419
locations what we are going to do next

324
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:57,070
is define points on this XY plane where

325
00:14:52,419 --> 00:15:00,459
we want to interpolate the data and so

326
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,440
you I encourage you to play around with

327
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,780
this and change the interpolation detail

328
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,600
here I'm just using arbitrarily I just

329
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,659
arbitrarily picked a value of 100 as the

330
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,019
level of detail so we are going to

331
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:16,899
interpolate 100 points between the

332
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:20,519
minimum and the maximum of these XY

333
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,519
plane coordinates

334
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:28,169
those so then this function mesh grid

335
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:29,769
just converts them from a

336
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,719
one-dimensional array to a

337
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:35,198
two-dimensional array which is important

338
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,449
for the topographical plotting so here

339
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,088
all the black dots this is where we are

340
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:43,208
going to estimate activity so the red

341
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:45,639
dots are where we actually measured data

342
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,649
these black dots we don't actually have

343
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,899
data so in some sense or in a very

344
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:52,509
strict sense we don't actually know what

345
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:55,389
was happening on the scalp at this

346
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:57,399
location however we are going to use a

347
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:01,028
weighted combination of all these other

348
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,129
electrodes to estimate what the activity

349
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:06,129
would look like at this point here and

350
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:08,740
that is going to allow us to create a

351
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:12,869
topographical map with more detail than

352
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:15,428
just these individuals 64 data points so

353
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:17,528
here you can see I used another plot

354
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:19,778
this is also it could have been done

355
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:22,178
using the normal plot function this is

356
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:26,039
just to introduce you to some other of

357
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:29,078
MATLAB functions so plot 3 we plot the

358
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:31,719
the x and y coordinates and here are

359
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:34,239
plotting these Z coordinates as minus 1

360
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,850
which just plots the black dots behind

361
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,259
the red circles so if you just use a

362
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,899
plot2d function then you would just see

363
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,298
that the black dots would be on top of

364
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:49,539
the red circles which I just think looks

365
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:50,948
a little bit less nice so you can see it

366
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:58,498
would look like this it's basically the

367
00:16:50,948 --> 00:17:02,798
same ok now what we are going to do is

368
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:04,838
compute the average activity at a an

369
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:07,028
arbitrary time point so I picked 100

370
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:10,389
milliseconds here we learned in a

371
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:12,398
previous video that this is the function

372
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,009
or one method that will allow us to

373
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:17,558
convert between the time point in

374
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:20,699
milliseconds that we want and the time

375
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:24,148
index so here we can we know that the

376
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:28,390
283rd time point in the EEG data

377
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:32,048
corresponds to a hundred milliseconds ok

378
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:35,080
and then we want to extract the average

379
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:37,599
data from this time point so we take

380
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:40,599
see data from all channels from this

381
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,579
time point from all trials and then we

382
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,250
take the mean over the third dimension

383
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:47,668
so that gives us the trial average this

384
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,490
particular interpolation function

385
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:53,200
requires that the input data the

386
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:56,528
double-precision or floating-point

387
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,330
precision and so the function double

388
00:17:56,528 --> 00:18:00,880
here is just to make sure that that

389
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:06,189
whatever comes out of here will not

390
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:09,190
produce an air during interpolation okay

391
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:14,200
and so this try scattered interrupt this

392
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:15,850
is a MATLAB function that it provides us

393
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,429
with the function to compute

394
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:22,928
interpolation so now we're going to

395
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:27,548
interpolate over these grid points all

396
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:32,500
these black dots here to get a 100 by

397
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:35,349
100 map of interpolated points and the

398
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,750
100 by 100 comes from this parameter

399
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:42,069
here so you can change this you can try

400
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:45,009
saving it to a thousand or 10 and see

401
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:47,769
what the difference is okay so now that

402
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:51,638
we have our interpolated data we are

403
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:53,710
going to plot this interpolated data and

404
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:58,869
I'm just plotting it in a few different

405
00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:01,240
ways just for comparison here I'm

406
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:04,028
plotting using the MATLAB function

407
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,329
contour F the F stands for filled here

408
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:09,970
using surf which stands for surface and

409
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:12,849
you can see that these appear to look

410
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:16,048
identical the only difference is with a

411
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:19,869
surface plot we are actually

412
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:22,089
representing this piece of data as a

413
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:24,459
surface as a landscape so you can see

414
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:29,138
that these edge values the microvolt

415
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:33,069
values are mapped here on to color what

416
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:36,808
I like about this representation is that

417
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:39,398
it helps you understand that these

418
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:41,740
features over multiple dimensions these

419
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:43,439
multi-dimensional feature spaces can be

420
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,579
conceptualized as

421
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,340
as landscapes as as a terrain so to

422
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,798
speak the contoured function that

423
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:54,569
actually is is just a flat function so

424
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,888
from when you're looking down of course

425
00:19:54,569 --> 00:20:00,990
it's the same as a surface image using

426
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:04,548
the function image or image SC which

427
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:07,159
means it just does some color scaling

428
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:10,769
you can see two differences between

429
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,159
image and contour the first is that the

430
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:15,750
image function appears to be a bit more

431
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,929
pixelated whereas contour appears to be

432
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,970
a bit smoother and the second and more

433
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:24,090
important difference is that the

434
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:27,329
direction of the y axis is flipped so

435
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:29,250
here the red this red feature is on the

436
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:31,408
bottom and here it's on the top you can

437
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,210
see when you look at the y axis that it

438
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:37,759
really is the same data this is just

439
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:41,579
flipped image by default shows in X

440
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:44,429
sorry i J coordinates instead of X Y

441
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:48,210
coordinates so it just has these smaller

442
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:51,090
numbers at the top it doesn't really

443
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,220
matter whether use image or contour but

444
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:55,798
it is important always to remember that

445
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,288
image is going to flip the y axis

446
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,970
relative to contour this is very

447
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:02,398
important when plotting time frequency

448
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,379
plots because you want to make sure that

449
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:06,239
you are labeling the y axis correctly

450
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:08,219
right you don't want to have the lower

451
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,190
plot the lower frequencies on the bottom

452
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,548
but you mistakenly think that the lower

453
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,110
frequencies on top or vice-versa it's

454
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:17,609
easy to get confused so you just always

455
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:23,308
have to make sure that you're careful

456
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:27,119
with the image se in this figure you see

457
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:30,599
the interpolated data using the EEG lab

458
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:35,189
toolbox function called topo plot so you

459
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:37,678
can see these it shows the same data but

460
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,679
of course they've added all these other

461
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,960
nice features like the the circle for

462
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,210
the head and locations of the ears and

463
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,179
the nose and things another difference

464
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,009
you can see is that eg labtop oplot

465
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,528
function is using a different

466
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:54,750
interpolation function they use one

467
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,289
called grid data here i used one called

468
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,009
trice

469
00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:00,659
interpret the difference is that this

470
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:03,259
function try scattered interval only

471
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,790
does interpolation it doesn't do

472
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:08,210
extrapolation and what that means is

473
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:13,109
that here is the boundary where we

474
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:15,299
recorded our data and anything within

475
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:17,069
this boundary would be interpolation

476
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,200
anything outside this boundary is

477
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,819
actually we it's not possible to

478
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,150
interpolate because there's nothing to

479
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:27,109
interpolate to so instead estimating a

480
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,820
point out here would be extrapolation

481
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:32,009
and so you can see that these values are

482
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,480
all ni n so they just don't exist

483
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:39,240
because these would be extrapolated

484
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:41,190
points with this grid data function it's

485
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,120
doing both interpolation and

486
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:48,660
extrapolation so it's it's also just

487
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,969
another difference to keep in mind so I

488
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,850
hope that helps you understand and be

489
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,240
able to interpret where topographical

490
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:59,909
maps come from and how data can be

491
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,269
represented from multiple channels over

492
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,269
space
