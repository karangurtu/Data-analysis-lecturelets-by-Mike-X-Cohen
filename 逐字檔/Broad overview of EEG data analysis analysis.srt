1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,770
very generally speaking the goal or the

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,559
overall idea of cognitive

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:13,109
electrophysiology is to try and

4
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:17,448
understand some of the processes of the

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:21,719
mind like working memory or language or

6
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:24,420
sensory perception emotion to the

7
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,809
dynamics in the brain to computations in

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,429
the brain by studying the electricity of

9
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,129
the brain of the electromagnetic waves

10
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:35,100
that are produced by the brain as the

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,609
brain is producing cognition so it's

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:43,500
just a very very overall general goal of

13
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:46,140
cognitive electrophysiology cognitive

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,378
electrophysiology is at the intersection

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,710
between psychology or cognitive science

16
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:56,119
and neuroscience and in particular

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:59,009
electrophysiology so as a cognitive

18
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:02,189
electrophysiologist is useful to think

19
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:05,548
about where on this very kind of

20
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:08,908
simplistic spectrum you you lie where

21
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,100
where you identify yourself with are you

22
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,229
more in the kind of psychology oriented

23
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,559
side or more on the neuroscience brain

24
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:18,450
oriented side this is an important thing

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,269
to think about because it will help

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,680
guide the papers that you should be

27
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:24,810
reading and critically thinking about

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,340
and the kinds of experiments that you

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,070
will plan on doing the types of data

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,430
analyses that you should be doing and

31
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:34,559
how to best interpret your results what

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,180
kinds of theoretical or empirical

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,700
frameworks you should be using to

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:45,750
interpret your results this lecture will

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:49,530
comprise four sections I'm not going to

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:54,118
go into any details about any data

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,670
analyses or data interpretations but

38
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:00,000
just to give you a very brief overview

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,978
of the the main approaches that are that

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,500
are used in cognitive electrophysiology

41
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:09,149
so time domain analyses frequency domain

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:13,310
analyses and the sort of intersection of

43
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,310
the two time frequency domain and Alice

44
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,640
so most people when they think of

45
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,760
time-domain

46
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,709
analyses with EEG or M eg data they are

47
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,939
thinking about ERPs event-related

48
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:30,700
potentials these are not the only

49
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,240
analyses that are possible in the time

50
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,939
domain

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,840
there's also microstates for example in

52
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:40,329
and multiscale dynamics are fractal

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,090
based dynamics but ear Peas are

54
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,990
certainly the dominant form of analysis

55
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:51,550
in the time domain here you see a bunch

56
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,950
of single trial EEG data I believe these

57
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,469
are from electrode FC Zed but it doesn't

58
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:59,709
matter the number here corresponds to

59
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:02,409
the trial number and times zero this

60
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,830
time is in milliseconds on the x-axis

61
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:08,590
time zero is when a stimulus appeared on

62
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,570
the screen in front of the subject so

63
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,599
here you can see that individual trials

64
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:15,430
seem to be quite variable so there's

65
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,000
there's quite a bit of variability over

66
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:22,510
the different trials in this plot you

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,990
can see all of the individual trials

68
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:29,439
there are 99 individual trials and the

69
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,900
the event related potential the ERP that

70
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,900
the average of all these trials plotted

71
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,770
in black to compute an ERP it's very

72
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:42,310
simple you just take the all of the the

73
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,409
trial voltage fluctuations at each time

74
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,719
point and average them together so very

75
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:49,859
simple just sum and divide by n and that

76
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,120
gives you the event related potential

77
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,520
one of the first things that you will

78
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,420
notice when looking at this plot is that

79
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,330
the ERP is is quite a bit smaller in

80
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:04,089
magnitude compared to the single trial

81
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,920
fluctuations here in in gray in fact the

82
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,340
ear peas tend to be somewhere around an

83
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,859
order of magnitude smaller than the

84
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,099
voltage potential fluctuations of the

85
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,609
individual trials now there's two ways

86
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:20,500
to interpret this some people interpret

87
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:23,978
this to indicate that single trial data

88
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,790
is very noisy these large fluctuations

89
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:27,939
are

90
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,600
indicative of just a lot of noise brain

91
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:34,180
noise and measurement noise and so by

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,090
averaging over a lot of trials we can

93
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,300
get rid of some of the noise and focus

94
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:43,149
on the the really relevant parts of the

95
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,090
signal an alternative interpretation is

96
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:51,009
that many of these dynamics are in fact

97
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:53,619
signal and they are they are meaningful

98
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:57,789
relevant for understanding the cognitive

99
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:00,160
process at hand here but these are non

100
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,890
phase-lock toward or jittered non

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,570
time-locked

102
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:09,399
processes and are therefore lost in the

103
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:11,980
time domain averaging so here in this

104
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,589
plot you can see the same ERP here is

105
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:20,950
just zoomed in a bit more so you can see

106
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:24,339
the fluctuations in finer detail ear

107
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,949
peas have been computed since I fired as

108
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:31,359
I know since the 1950s probably or

109
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:34,089
possibly earlier as well the general

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,939
idea the kind of foundational framework

111
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:39,609
for thinking about interpreting erps is

112
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:41,439
that there is a sequence of cognitive

113
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,960
operations that are happening in the

114
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,829
brain and some of these cognitive

115
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:53,159
operations map on to the peaks or the

116
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:57,519
troughs of these these ERP fluctuations

117
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,840
and so whether you agree that this is an

118
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,899
appropriate model that there are

119
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:04,709
sequential cognitive modules that are

120
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:07,629
being activated and they map on to these

121
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:10,060
peaks and and sort of alternating

122
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:13,719
polarity Peaks in the event related

123
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,480
potential is is something you can think

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,130
about on your own but this is one of the

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,110
main driving ideologies behind

126
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,509
interpreting AR Peas this is just to

127
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,170
give you the reference for where I got

128
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,170
this figure from

129
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,779
so the advantages of event-related

130
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,889
potentials are that they are

131
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:42,019
computationally very simple it really is

132
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:44,839
just just sum and divide by n in fact

133
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:47,359
your phone could probably compute an ERP

134
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:51,169
basically as fast as a supercomputer

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,230
could there's also a decades-old very

136
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,439
large very rich literature on using ERPs

137
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,990
to try and understand and make

138
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,810
inferences about cognitive processes and

139
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,019
so this can be a very good thing there's

140
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:09,470
a very large literature in which to

141
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:11,029
embed and relate your findings some of

142
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,820
the disadvantages of event-related

143
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:16,129
potentials are that as I briefly

144
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:20,089
mentioned jittered and non phase-locked

145
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:22,909
activities are are lost I will in a

146
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:25,339
future video define more precisely what

147
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,800
these terms mean and how we can measure

148
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:32,299
and and extract these non phase-lock

149
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,490
dynamics for the researchers who lean a

150
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,189
bit more towards the neuroscience side

151
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,300
of the spectrum the air peas provide a

152
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:43,459
limited scope of data analysis

153
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,650
possibilities that might be of interest

154
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:50,649
to someone who is focusing more on the

155
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:52,879
neuroscience aspect such as

156
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:57,379
synchronization cross frequency coupling

157
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,560
these kinds of dynamics ERP is in

158
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:04,250
particularly the later more cognitive

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,740
components of the ERP spectrum tend to

160
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,370
have low signal to noise characteristics

161
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,720
or low statistical power this is not

162
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,240
mathematically necessarily the case this

163
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,230
is just occasionally empirically

164
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,449
observed there is also a kind of an

165
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,300
unclear link to underlying

166
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,219
neurophysiology again particularly for

167
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,980
the later components it's it's a bit

168
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:34,009
less clear exactly how these alternating

169
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,959
streams of polarity reversing potentials

170
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:39,569
are are produced in the brain and what

171
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:45,208
what they what the significance of those

172
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:48,959
of those ERP components is okay so now

173
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:52,439
we get to frequency domain analyses just

174
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,569
by way of a very brief non mechanistic

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,139
introduction to frequency domain

176
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:01,769
analyses the idea of frequency domain

177
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:03,629
based analyses is to represent and

178
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,350
analyze the signal not in the time

179
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:09,389
domain but in the frequency domain

180
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,389
probably or hopefully you have at least

181
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:15,389
some passing familiarity with how to

182
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:17,100
interpret these frequency domain plots

183
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,629
but just briefly you can see you so

184
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,759
here's the time domain this is a one

185
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:23,009
second tick mark so this is two seconds

186
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,708
in total and you can see that this

187
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:29,299
signal has one two three Peaks within

188
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:32,609
one second so we would call that 3 Hertz

189
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:35,578
Hertz is a unit of frequency it's it's 1

190
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,159
over seconds and so your three Peaks is

191
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:40,500
corresponds to 3 Hertz it's very simple

192
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,389
the amplitude is one that might seem a

193
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,669
little strange because here you see in a

194
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:47,159
time domain the amplitude of the sine

195
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:49,139
wave seems to vary between 1 and minus 1

196
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:54,990
so you might be wondering how do we get

197
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:58,259
this bar only at at 1 we will discuss in

198
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:01,669
a future video that in fact this sine

199
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:04,919
wave is best conceptualized as a

200
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:07,198
circular process that's cycling around

201
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,620
with a constant distance from the origin

202
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:12,389
of 1 and what you see here as going up

203
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,659
and down is really just a projection

204
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:19,049
onto the real axis going back and forth

205
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:22,230
like this if that sounds sort of wacky

206
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:25,139
or fantastical then then you can look

207
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,259
forward to the video on the Fourier

208
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:32,129
transform where I discussed this in more

209
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:34,439
detail so here's the frequency

210
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:36,240
representation this signal here is the

211
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,730
frequency representation of this signal

212
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,539
you can see it is oscillating faster and

213
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:46,500
it has lower amplitude so here it as the

214
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:49,939
the bar is at a higher frequency 8 Hertz

215
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,740
and the amplitude is lower at 5 Hertz

216
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,580
in this panel you see the some of these

217
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,919
two signals and with these two pure sine

218
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,610
waves it's fairly easy to look at this

219
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,110
and see that there are two sine waves

220
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,810
but you can already see with this very

221
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,360
simple example that the constituent

222
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:12,659
parts the components of this signal are

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,519
easier to identify in the frequency

224
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,519
domain compared to in the time domain

225
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:23,850
this advantage of the frequency domain

226
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,379
is much more prominent in a signal it

227
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,320
looks like this so this looks like a

228
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:31,559
very complex noisy signal it may be

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,350
difficult to see or to identify how many

230
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,869
different components are in this signal

231
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,149
in the time domain but in the frequency

232
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,269
domain it's much easier we can see that

233
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:45,679
there is one two three four sine wave

234
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:50,039
components of of the signal plus some

235
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:54,000
low amplitude broadband noise in here so

236
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:57,860
it's much easier to talk about this

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,860
signal in terms of the frequency domain

238
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,440
okay so how do we get to the frequency

239
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:08,310
domain we do this by something called

240
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,459
the the Fourier transform which was put

241
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:13,049
forth by Joseph Fourier and according to

242
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:16,099
Wikipedia this is what he looked like

243
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:19,439
the Fourier theorem specifies that any

244
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,379
signal can be expressed or represented

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,140
as a combination of different sine waves

246
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,778
each sine wave having a different

247
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:31,259
frequency amplitude and phase so we will

248
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:34,679
talk in in glorious detail in the future

249
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:37,338
about how these frequencies are created

250
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:41,639
and how the amplitudes and phases are

251
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:46,350
computed but for now you can just know

252
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:47,850
that that any signal can be expressed

253
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,230
perfectly it can be perfectly

254
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:55,980
represented using a bunch of sine waves

255
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:57,839
and so the very sort of general

256
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,659
conceptual idea of how the Fourier

257
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,339
transform works is something like this

258
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,949
so you start with a signal this is a

259
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,110
single trial

260
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,670
of EEG data so you can see the voltage

261
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,800
fluctuations going up and down over time

262
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:15,289
and then we take a sine wave of some

263
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,079
particular frequency and we line it on

264
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:21,439
top of the EEG data and now we want to

265
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,290
know how similar are these two time

266
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,450
series now similar is put in apology

267
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:29,360
quotes here because what we are going to

268
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,000
measure is not really something called

269
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,039
similarity if you think of measuring

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,149
similarity you probably think of like a

271
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:39,679
correlation coefficient in fact the

272
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,769
Fourier transform uses something called

273
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,870
it a dot product which we will discuss

274
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:47,960
in more detail in the future but you can

275
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,929
just think about how much of this sine

276
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,600
wave can you see in this or can you

277
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:56,479
detect in this EEG data snippet and

278
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,370
we'll call that for now you know will

279
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,509
kind of temporarily call that similarity

280
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:05,179
so the amount of similarity is plotted

281
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:07,309
on the y-axis and is plotted in a

282
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:11,029
position corresponding to the frequency

283
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:13,909
of the sine wave so this is one step in

284
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:17,569
getting from a time domain into the

285
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:19,730
frequency domain and now we repeat this

286
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,520
step for another sine wave with another

287
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,860
frequency and another sine wave with

288
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,740
another frequency and now you can see we

289
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,190
are constructing this this full

290
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,620
representation of the time domain signal

291
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,630
in the frequency domain again the

292
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,889
mechanics of all this will become clear

293
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:43,100
in a future video ok so we can do this

294
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:44,779
now for reals and get a frequency domain

295
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,230
representation that looks something like

296
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,389
this

297
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:52,399
so we can see for example that there's

298
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:55,039
so much amplitude of a 25 Hertz sine

299
00:14:52,399 --> 00:15:00,590
wave that can be measured in this time

300
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:03,079
domain signal so that's very nice the

301
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,820
advantages of the Fourier transform are

302
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,090
that it was also computationally very

303
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:11,210
fast and the Fourier transform is

304
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:14,240
ubiquitous in science and engineering so

305
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,579
you can go to a cocktail party with

306
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,558
engineers and physicists and

307
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:20,178
petitions and talk about the Fourier

308
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:23,838
transform and you will all be on the

309
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:30,139
same page so that's a very nice feature

310
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:33,739
of your data analysis stream but there

311
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:37,639
are some disadvantages of a frequency

312
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:39,798
domain representation of the data the

313
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,019
Fourier transform the results of a

314
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:45,039
Fourier transform are easily

315
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:49,730
interpretable only for stationary data

316
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:53,149
um briefly stationary our stationarity

317
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:56,119
refers to the statistical

318
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:58,419
characteristics of the data changing or

319
00:15:56,119 --> 00:16:01,160
not changing over time so stationary

320
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,778
time series means that these statistical

321
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:05,928
characteristics the mean and the

322
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:09,110
variance and so on are are not changing

323
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:10,730
over time but this is awkward for

324
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,759
Neuroscience because we know that the

325
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,480
brain is a highly non stationary device

326
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,028
in fact it is it is no understatement to

327
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,259
say that neuroscientists are generally

328
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:27,198
interested in the non stationarity these

329
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:30,199
transient fluctuations these kind of

330
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:34,269
bizarre changes in brain activity

331
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:38,628
resulting from the or accompanying

332
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:40,759
cognitive processes so to be clear the

333
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,459
Fourier transform is a perfect

334
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,619
representation of the data regardless of

335
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:48,528
whether it is stationary or non

336
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:50,839
stationary but the results of a Fourier

337
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:53,600
transform are more difficult to

338
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,850
interpret when the data are very non

339
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,100
stationary and we will discuss this and

340
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,639
all gives very specific examples of this

341
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,519
in the future in part this is because

342
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,220
the Fourier transform hides the temporal

343
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,919
information there's also I want to be

344
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,409
careful when saying this because all of

345
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,449
the temporal information is actually in

346
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:16,880
the Fourier transform it's in the phases

347
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:20,240
although the phases are not generally

348
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,220
shown but from the results of a Fourier

349
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,769
transform it's difficult to determine

350
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,709
exactly when different frequency

351
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:29,388
components are present and so if we go

352
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,890
back to this part we can say that there

353
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:34,729
is some 25 Hertz

354
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:38,120
component in this signal but from this

355
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:41,170
plot it is not possible to determine

356
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:44,419
whether that 25 Hertz component is

357
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:48,320
constant over time or whether there is

358
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,800
very strong 25 Hertz here and no 25

359
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,529
Hertz

360
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,230
signals over here or whether 25 Hertz

361
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:56,440
signal is coming in bursts

362
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,839
none of these temporal dynamics can be

363
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,970
easily ascertained just by looking at

364
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,949
this plot but in fact these temporal

365
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:09,920
dynamics are things that we are very

366
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:13,759
interested in as neuroscientists the

367
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,070
reason why the Fourier transform makes

368
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,920
it difficult to interpret the temporal

369
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:20,899
dynamics is that with the Fourier

370
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,700
transform or the Fourier transform

371
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,110
involves computing the dot product

372
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,690
that's something we will discuss in the

373
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:29,629
future between a pure sine wave so a

374
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,029
signal that looks like this with the EEG

375
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:36,200
data and so you can imagine that the

376
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:40,369
weighting function would be constant

377
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,350
over time so that's why it we we don't

378
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:46,129
really get any temporal precision with

379
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:48,519
the Fourier transform but what we would

380
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:53,090
like in neuroscience is to be able to

381
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:56,720
combine the frequencies specificity of

382
00:18:53,089 --> 00:19:00,589
the Fourier transform with some ability

383
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,799
to extract the temporal dynamics of when

384
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:06,649
particular frequency features are

385
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,529
present in the data and so one of the

386
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:14,030
ways to do this is by using a time

387
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:15,740
limited sine wave or a time series that

388
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,690
look something like this in this case

389
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,920
this happens to be a more late wavelet

390
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,710
this is not the only way to to perform a

391
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,509
time frequency based analyses we will

392
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,640
discuss this in more depth in the future

393
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:31,549
but you can already imagine so assume

394
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,560
that these are zeros here that the

395
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:35,359
weighting function would look something

396
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,029
like this so here we are very strongly

397
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,729
waiting just the center and we are

398
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:42,829
ignoring any dynamics that are happening

399
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,110
here in the beginning and here at the

400
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:46,259
end

401
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:51,418
and so convolution involves taking this

402
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:53,879
signal and sliding it over time to to

403
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,220
move this waiting function here and here

404
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,250
and here and that allows us to extract

405
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,600
these temporal dynamics that are

406
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:06,359
frequency bands specific and so this is

407
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,189
the basic idea of a time frequency based

408
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,808
approach or time frequency domain

409
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:14,519
analyses we find a trade-off between

410
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:18,750
temporal dynamics and frequency

411
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:20,370
precision so that allows us to produce

412
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,558
plots that might look something like

413
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:26,658
this here you see time on this axis and

414
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:30,329
the x axis and frequency on the y-axis

415
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:33,350
with smaller numbers indicating or

416
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:37,319
corresponding to slower oscillations and

417
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:42,418
higher numbers corresponding to faster

418
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:46,079
oscillations and the color or the the

419
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:48,659
kind of depth in the plot corresponds to

420
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,298
well it can correspond to a variety of

421
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:54,240
features that we can obtain using a time

422
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:58,129
frequency based approach in this

423
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,690
particular example I am plotting power

424
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,600
converted to a decibel change from

425
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,210
baseline and so power refers to the the

426
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:09,959
energy in the signal and so red means

427
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:12,480
relatively higher amplitude oscillations

428
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,149
and blue would mean relatively lower

429
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:21,389
amplitude oscillations relative to the

430
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:23,518
pre stimulus baseline one thing that we

431
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:27,269
will also discuss in the future that is

432
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,759
often sometimes necessary very often

433
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:33,720
useful is some kind of a baseline

434
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:36,619
normalization here you can see a time

435
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,990
frequency power plot of raw power and

436
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:44,099
here you can see the exact same data the

437
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,679
exact same analyses except that here the

438
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,379
the power data were converted to a

439
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:52,288
baseline normalized scale so it's quite

440
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,600
a striking difference between these two

441
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:56,269
plots so in this case you would say that

442
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,769
converting to

443
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:02,539
or normalizing the data somehow is is is

444
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:06,319
really important for being able to

445
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:08,649
interpret the dynamics now this was a

446
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,720
little bit of a carefully selected

447
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:14,630
example it's not always the case that

448
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:18,910
the raw power and the baseline

449
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:22,010
normalized power are so so different

450
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,779
here you see another case this is the

451
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,900
same data set just a different electrode

452
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:28,428
being plotted I think it's Oh Rosie or a

453
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,730
one somewhere in the back of the head

454
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:34,759
and here of course there are differences

455
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,740
between the raw power and the DB

456
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,349
normalized power but the differences are

457
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,609
not so striking relative to this

458
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:47,419
particular electrode there are several

459
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:49,969
advantages of applying a baseline

460
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:54,590
normalization to time frequency based

461
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:57,380
analyses it allows you to transform all

462
00:22:54,589 --> 00:23:00,649
the data to the same scales decibel or

463
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:04,790
percent change this is a numerically

464
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:08,450
interpretable scale whereas micro volts

465
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:12,849
are more difficult to interpret and and

466
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:14,960
more difficult to compare across studies

467
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,779
baseline normalization allows you to

468
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,039
disentangle task-related from background

469
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:23,720
activity and decibel normalized power is

470
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,289
more likely to be normally distributed

471
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,009
which of course is very good for

472
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:31,549
statistics particularly if you would

473
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:33,920
like to use parametric statistics such

474
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:39,200
as ANOVA's or regressions or these kinds

475
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:42,259
of statistical analyses so again these

476
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,569
are issues that are important and we

477
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:48,379
will go into these in more detail in

478
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:51,710
dedicated videos in the future

479
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:55,100
baseline normalization is almost always

480
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:58,009
a good idea it is not always necessary

481
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:59,779
and in fact sometimes it is specifically

482
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:02,599
not a good idea but in most cases

483
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:08,269
baseline normalization is a good thing

484
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:09,919
and should be done okay so time

485
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:13,670
frequency

486
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:19,130
based analyses or approaching EEG data

487
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:23,120
in a time frequency frame of mind has

488
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:26,210
several advantages I think arguably this

489
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:30,169
approach allows you to get as close to

490
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:34,730
the underlying nerve physiology as as is

491
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:37,160
possible with with EEG data it provides

492
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,720
very flexible framework for many types

493
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,250
of analyses which I'll talk about a

494
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,130
little bit more detail on the next slide

495
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:45,430
there are many so-called low-hanging

496
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,690
fruits this means that there are many

497
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:50,360
cognitive processes ease mental

498
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,000
processes that simply have not really

499
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:55,579
been very well mapped using time

500
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,559
frequency based analyses so there are

501
00:24:55,579 --> 00:25:03,439
many opportunities for for kind of

502
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:06,970
interesting and uncharted areas in

503
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,289
cognitive neuroscience to be explored

504
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:13,460
time frequency based analyses are

505
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:16,549
amenable both to very strict theory

506
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,660
guided hypothesis testing as well as

507
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:23,839
very open exploratory data analyses so I

508
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:26,090
think it's appealing both for sort of

509
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,849
theoretical oriented people as well as

510
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:31,159
methodology oriented people and of

511
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:34,039
course allows you to produce some very

512
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,320
pretty colored plots that's it you know

513
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,730
it's a non scientific advantage but it's

514
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:44,119
a it's a nice thing than the last

515
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:46,849
perhaps the main disadvantage of time

516
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:49,399
frequency based analyses is that there's

517
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:52,879
necessarily reduced temporal precision

518
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:57,410
and also reduced frequency precision

519
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,780
this is a necessary consequence of of of

520
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:02,740
the trade-off between temporal

521
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:05,480
information and frequency information

522
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,970
the reason why this is the case is

523
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,789
something we will discuss in more depth

524
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,680
but one might reasonably ask whether

525
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:15,049
this really matters this reduced

526
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,410
temporal precision if you go on the

527
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:20,509
order of milliseconds to hundreds of

528
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,759
milliseconds or more often tens of

529
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:26,970
milliseconds I think our

530
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:30,259
the interpretations of the results would

531
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:33,360
not change very much in most cases

532
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:35,960
whether you had slightly better or

533
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,789
slightly worse temporal precision I

534
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,350
would also like to point out that ERP is

535
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,409
in particular the later cognitive

536
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:46,559
components like the P 3 and n 400 these

537
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:51,180
also have very poor temporal precision

538
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:53,159
for example P 3 is often measured as you

539
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,400
know the positive component peaking

540
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,140
somewhere between 300 and 600

541
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,480
milliseconds so now you're talking about

542
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,900
a temporal precision of a third of a

543
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:09,150
second which is in fact worse than then

544
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:15,900
some parameter spaces in time frequency

545
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:17,610
based analyses okay another advantage or

546
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,740
one of the advantages i've mentioned on

547
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:22,369
the last slide of time frequency domain

548
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,620
analysis is that it is an entire

549
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:28,649
framework that that lends itself well to

550
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:31,109
many different types of analyses for

551
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,560
example this is a tiny subset of all the

552
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:36,599
possible data analysis approaches that

553
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,379
you can take with time frequency based

554
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,069
analyses

555
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,870
there's connectivity based on phase

556
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:44,369
fluctuations power dynamics across

557
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,979
frequency coupling mutual information

558
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:49,889
and so on there are all sorts of spatial

559
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,680
transforms that in some cases these are

560
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,100
not specifically based on frequency

561
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,930
domain utilizations but they lend

562
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:06,389
themselves very well to inspection of

563
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:09,570
frequency dynamics and yeah there's a

564
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,840
whole laundry list of possible analysis

565
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:15,240
approaches that you can that are sort of

566
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,419
justifiable based on brain physiology

567
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,059
and and known neuro physiological

568
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:24,120
dynamics that that can be used in EEG

569
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:25,799
studies of course you know I should I'll

570
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:30,859
have a video about this in future but

571
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:33,990
it's important to keep in mind that that

572
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:36,879
analyses of EEG data should be guided

573
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,259
towards or restricted by

574
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,050
something that's known about the brain

575
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:43,960
we need to be able to link the results

576
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:47,169
of our analyses back to something that

577
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,970
we know is is happening in the brain so

578
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,590
nonetheless time frequency based

579
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,730
analyses I think are really a very

580
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:59,519
powerful way of thinking about way of

581
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,519
approaching your EEG data
